                <p>This is story of a woman, who has always lived in two different worlds. One where life was perfect, it was made of pure good, everything was
beautiful, and everyone was appreciative about her. This was the world of her thoughts, this was her home, where she was locked up most of time.
Keeping all the doors and windows shut most of time.</p>
<p>
And then there was the outer world. Filled with beautiful shades of black white and grays ..<br/>

First she entered there as a young ambitious girl and then emerged as a strong successful woman.<br/>

She was juggling the multiple hats of a daughter, wife mother , professional, entrepreneur and The boss, trying to be the best in everything. She
wanted to prove herself, achieve unmatched heights, She was doing day by day. Competing with the world and herself, this was a non-stop run,
fatigue was building,she started losing, losing herself, her laughter, her smile, her health and her sense of judgement.

chatter(stress & anxiety).<br/>

And the most mystical thing happened in most mysterious way, in her words,<b>"I wasn't me anymore or rather first time in my life I was
me"</b>. I was able to see things differently and clearly and somehow world started changing. Stress started melting and love started flowingâ€¦...</p>
